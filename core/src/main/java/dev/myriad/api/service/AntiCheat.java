 * What the server checks, so a feature can be careful where it has to be and quick where it doesn't, without every
 * module asking the player "is this server strict?".
 * <p>
 * The player picks the profile in the Profiles panel (or with {@code .anticheat}); the default, {@link Mode#AUTO},
 * works it out per server. The services follow it through their {@code forServer()} presets
 * ({@link Placement.Options#forServer()}, {@link Breaking.Options#forServer()}, {@link Rotations.Options#forServer()},
 * {@link Building.Options#forServer()}), and the inventory service only waits for a safe moment to click
 * ({@link Inventory#safeToClick()}) where it matters. Use the presets, or ask {@link #isStrict()} yourself:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Myriad.placement().place(this, pos, slot, Placement.Options.forServer());
 * if (Myriad.antiCheat().isStrict()) delay = Math.max(delay, 1);
 * }</pre>
