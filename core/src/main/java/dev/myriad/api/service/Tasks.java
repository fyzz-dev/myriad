/**
 * Work spread over game ticks: "do this in 5 ticks", "every 10 ticks", or a sequence of steps that wait for
 * conditions (open a chest, wait until it has loaded, move items, close it). Everything runs on the render thread at
 * the end of a tick. Tasks belong to an owner; a module's tasks are cancelled when it's disabled.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Myriad.tasks().sequence(this)
 *     .await(() -> Myriad.containers().open(pos, 20), 40)   // waits for the future; a failure fails the sequence
 *     .require(() -> Myriad.containers().current().isPresent(), "The chest closed")
 *     .run(this::moveItems)
 *     .wait(2)
 *     .run(Myriad.containers()::close)
 *     .retry(2)                                             // start over up to twice if a step fails
 *     .onFail(t -> warn("Couldn't restock: " + t.getMessage()))
 *     .start();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * A sequence fails when a step throws, a {@link Sequence#require} check is false, an {@link Sequence#await}ed
 * future fails or a wait times out (with a {@link java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException}).
