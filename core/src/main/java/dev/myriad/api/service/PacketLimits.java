/**
 * A shared budget for packets servers count, so that several modules acting at once (or one module on a fast loop)
 * don't add up to a kick. Every packet of each kind is counted as it's sent, by vanilla or by any feature, and
 * Myriad's services ({@code placement()}, {@code inventory()}) check the budget before they send, returning false
 * instead of sending when it's spent. It refills continuously, so try again next tick.
 *
 * <p>Check it yourself before sending your own packets of these kinds:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (!Myriad.limits().canSend(PacketLimits.Kind.INTERACT, 1)) return; // next tick
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Wrap actions that must happen whatever the cost, like putting a totem in your off hand, in {@link #urgent}.
