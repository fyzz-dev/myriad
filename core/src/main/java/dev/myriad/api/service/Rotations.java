 * Server-side rotation arbitration. Modules {@link #request} a rotation every tick they need one; each tick the
 * winning request is sent in the movement packet and all requests are cleared. The camera is not moved.
 *
 * <p>Yaw and pitch are arbitrated separately: pass {@link Float#NaN} for an axis you don't care about and another
 * module may take it (Elytra Fly steering pitch while an aura aims yaw). For each axis the highest priority request
 * wins; ties go to the first request.
 *
 * <p>With {@link Options}, a request can turn at a limited speed instead of snapping, and can correct your movement
 * for the rotation (see {@link Options#moveFix}). When requests stop, a rotation that was turning eases back to where
 * you look at the same speed instead of snapping back.
