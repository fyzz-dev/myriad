/**
 * Shared block breaking for Nuker, tunnellers, speed mine, auto city and anything else that breaks blocks. Modules
 * ask for a position to be broken and get told when the server has broken it; the service mines one block at a time
 * (two with {@link Options#doubleBreak}) in priority order, breaks instant blocks in batches, picks and holds the
 * fastest tool, rotates if asked, shows the crack, and keeps placements and breaks from overlapping. Breaking runs
 * on its own packets, so it doesn't fight the player's own mining or the attack key.
 *
