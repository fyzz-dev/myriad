/**
 * Builds a {@link Blueprint}: describe the shape you want, and the planner works out each tick, for what's in reach,
 * what to break and what to place, in an order that works, and does it through {@link Breaking} and
 * {@link Placement}. Nuker, tunnelers, highway builders, surround, scaffold and printers become mostly a blueprint.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Wrong blocks are broken first, top down so falling blocks drop into space that's already been cleared,
 *   never the one you stand on, and (by default) not if it lets a fluid in.</li>
 *   <li>Placements go bottom up and nearest first, so each one has something to be placed against; a position
 *   with nothing to click waits until a neighbour is placed.</li>
 *   <li>Materials come from the hotbar, moved there from the inventory when needed.</li>
 *   <li>Oriented targets ({@code Target.state}) are placed facing the right way: the planner tries the clicks it
 *   could make and the rotation each needs, as the game would place them, and uses one that comes out right.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Build build = Myriad.building().start(this, Blueprint.box(a, b, Target.air()), Building.Options.DEFAULT);
 * build.finished().thenAccept(done -> info(done ? "Tunnel finished" : "Stopped"));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * A module's builds stop when it's disabled.
