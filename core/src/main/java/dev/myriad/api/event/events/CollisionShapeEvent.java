/**
 * The collision shape of a block, as the local player's movement sees it. Replace it to walk on what isn't solid
 * (water, lava, powder snow), keep out of what hurts (fire, cactus, berry bushes), or pass through blocks; only your
 * own movement changes. Posted for every block near you every tick, on the render thread, so keep handlers cheap and
 * don't keep {@link #pos()} (it may be reused).
