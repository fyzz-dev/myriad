 * dangerous. Reading it from a render handler at 200 frames a second then costs the work once, not 200 times.

 * private final TickCached<List<Entity>> targets = TickCached.of(() -> Targets.query().range(64).list());

 * @Subscribe
 * private void onRender(Render3DEvent e) {

 *
 * Not thread-safe beyond the render thread; a read from another thread may compute the value a second time.
