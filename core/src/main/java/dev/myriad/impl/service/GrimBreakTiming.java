/**
 * Grim's break timing (its FastBreak check), followed from the dig packets sent, so breaks can be finished and started
 * as early as it lets them without being refused.
 * <p>
 * Grim times a break from its start packet: it expects {@code ceil(1 / damage) * 50} ms, where damage is the best
 * progress per tick it has seen for the block it was last told to start (sampled on every movement and swing packet,
 * with the Efficiency it has had back from the server). A finish sooner than that adds the shortfall to a balance
 * (one finish within 25 ms of its time instead takes 10% off it); a start sooner than 275 ms after the last finish adds
 * {@code 300 - gap} to another (a later one takes 10% off). Past 1000 on either, it refuses the packet. Both are kept
 * under a margin here.
 * <p>
 * Air breaks at once (its damage is infinite, so its time is 0), and Grim neither checks that a finish is for the block
 * it was timing nor, on servers with ViaVersion, skips starts on air: after a start on air, any finish passes. That's
 * the decoy start 2b2t clients send (see {@code Breaking.Mode.FAST_GRIM}).
