 * <li>otherwise all together, on the first workspace with room for all of them;</li>
 * <li>and when there are more than one workspace holds, filling empty workspaces in category order.</li>
 * </ol>
 * With no empty workspace left and none with room for them all, the least crowded workspace takes the rest.
 * A workspace has room while it holds fewer tiled windows than {@code capacity} (as many as fit side by side at a
 * readable width). Only windows the desktop hasn't seen are placed; anything already arranged stays where it is.
